# Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math

[Link to puzzle description](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/2)

## Puzzle Summary

The elves are running low on wrapping paper and need to order exactly whatâ€™s required. Each present is a perfect rectangular box with dimensions `l x w x h` (in feet).

To compute the required wrapping paper per present:
- Surface area: `2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l`
- Extra (slack): the area of the smallest side

Total paper for one present = surface area + smallest-side area.

### Examples

- For `2x3x4`:  
  - Sides: `lw=6`, `wh=12`, `hl=8`  
  - Surface: `2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52`  
  - Slack: `min(6, 12, 8) = 6`  
  - Total: `58`

- For `1x1x10`:  
  - Sides: `lw=1`, `wh=10`, `hl=10`  
  - Surface: `2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42`  
  - Slack: `min(1, 10, 10) = 1`  
  - Total: `43`

## Your Task

Given a list of dimensions (one per line, formatted as `LxWxH`), compute the total number of square feet of wrapping paper needed across all presents.

## Instructions

1. Put your puzzle input in `src/input.json` (as a string with line breaks, or an array of strings).
2. Run the solution:

```ruby
    cd 2015/days/day-02
